Please ask questions in the slack if you're confused. This is new to me too, so we can help eachother out. Don't feel bad if you don't understand something! :D

The workflow pretty much will include us,
  downloading the current files
  work on the files you downloaded
  copy the lines that you changed and paste it into the files on github
  
Only paste the lines that you changed because your version may not be the most up to date and if you copy and paste all your code you may remove work other people have done!!!!
